        ### ðŸ¤– Information for Coding Team
        
        **Implementation Planning:**
        - Assess technical feasibility within current architecture
        - Identify required database schema changes
        - Consider impact on existing functionality
        - Plan for user interface changes
        - Evaluate third-party integrations needed

        - Plan for user acceptance testing with teachers
        
        **Documentation Updates:**
        - Update user documentation for new feature
        - Add API documentation if new endpoints
        - Update development guide if architecture changes
        - Create user training materials if needed
        
        **Security & Privacy:**
        - Ensure FERPA compliance for student data
        - Validate permission controls work correctly
